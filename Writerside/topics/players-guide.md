# The Player's Guide

## Introduction

This guide will teach you how to play Fantasy Frontiers, and how to use the bot's commands.

### Glossary

- **Character**: A character is a virtual representation of a player in the game. Each player can have one character globally.
- **Town**: A town is a location in the game.
- **Guild**: A guild is a group of players that share a common goal. Currently, there are four guilds in the game: The Adventurer's Guild, the Merchant's Guild, the Herbologist's Guild, and the Blacksmith's Guild.
  - Each guild has a special building in the game, located in one of the main cities. This building is called the guild hall.
  - Inside the guild hall you can join the guild, access the guild's shop and (if you are a guild member) the quest board.
- **Quest**: A quest is a special task that you can complete to earn rewards. Quests are issued by the guilds.


## Getting Started

##### The Main-Hub

Each server has a main-hub channel. This channel is the main hub for the bot, where you can interact with most of the game's features through buttons and select menus.
The main-game button is the `ðŸŽ¯ Start your fantasy jouney!` button.

On the official server, the main-hub channel is called `ðŸ“œ-Â»-game-hub`.


##### Creating a Character

To create a character, click the main-game button in the main-hub channel.

First, the bot will ask you to choose your preferred language. You can currently choose between English and German. (If you want to help us translate the bot, please refer to the [Contribution Guidelines](contribution-guidelines.md))

After that, you can choose your character's first and last name. You can choose any name you like, as long as it is not against the [tos](tos.md).

If you have no idea what to choose, you can use the [Fantasy Name Generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/anime-character-names.php) to generate a random name.

##### The first skill

After creating your character, you will be asked to choose your first skill.

Choose wisely, as this skill will be your first skill, and you will not be able to change it later.
Some skills are more useful or rarer than others, depending on your playstyle.


##### The first town

You start your journey in the small village of MistMeadow.
